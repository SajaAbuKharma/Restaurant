## Restaurant Project
### Task 11
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
Today will be the beginning of a multi-lab project, where you will build a restaurant project with pairing partners.

Requirements
Set up your Github Repository*
Create a new repository called Restaurant
Add a README file to add your changes for each day.
Clone this repo to your local machine.
Check out a new branch called events for today's lab.
Open it in VS code.
You will create only one page for this lab index.html.

Home page
Header for navigating to any other pages.

You will add a form with the following fields:

Food Name.
Types of the food <select> with the following options:
Fruit and vegetables.
Starchy food.
Dairy.
Protein.
Fat.
Price.
Submit button.
Footer will have some social media links with copyright.

Javascript
You will create a constructor to generate a food object which will be rendered in the main section of your app.js file.
Food ID.
Food Name.
Type.
Price.
You will create an instance each time you submit the form, and fill the object from the form inputs. 2. Create a method to generate a unique four digits for the food id number. 3. You will add an event listener to get the data from the form instead of having hard-coded data. 4. You will create a render prototype method to render each food name with their information from the form on the home page as a table view as below.

Note: You will render the data in the table whenever you submit the form (you will use event listener for the form).

Style

Add backgrounds, font colors, google fonts, and any additional style.
Use a suitable color palette for your website. You can use ColorHunt .
Note: Be creative and make your page professional.
